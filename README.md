# JavaScript30
This repository stores plain JS solutions for each of the 30 days of the Javascript 30 challenge. The challenge consisted of using HTML, JS and CSS to create fun solutions that show just how useful plain JS is for designing web pages, and it sure is! I hope you enjoy these projects I've put my creativity into. :D
